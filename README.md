# Using machine learning to understand the drivers of nutrients in constrasting coastal ecosystems

## Overview

## Example Workflow

### Get to know the data

All raw data is in the _"data_NERR"_ folder: "cbv" and "owc". For each location we have a folder that splits up water quality, nutrient, and meteorlogical data specied in different folder, respectively. This is how NERR gives us the data for these locations, so we suspect this procedure to be standard. 

We highly encourage you to create boxplots to observe the mean and distribution of your features as below for each location:

### Filter and Process Data

### Train the RF model

### Analyze Data

## Contributions

Code edits or concerns are welcome and appreciated! Insert these in [Issues](https://github.com/COMPASS-DOE/bgc_synthesis/issues) or [Pull Request](https://github.com/COMPASS-DOE/bgc_synthesis/projects) depending on severity. 

## Data Sources

Data came from NERR from 2000 to 2020.
